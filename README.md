# supplychain_planner_PoC
Following perspectives are practical for modeling the supply chain:  1. Plan with a weekly granularity 2. Align with Common Planning Units across entire supply chain 3. Consider bottlenecks 4. Consider the cost structure and value linkage 5. Apply optimization functions  To verify these concepts, a simple planning tool is modeled in Python, as PoC.

When considering the planning functions of a global supply chain, I believe it is necessary to model the supply chain from the following perspectives:

- Starting from the method and timing of providing product services to customers
- Considering the balance of supply and demand across the entire supply chain
- Maintaining consistency between overall supply chain management and the order processing operations of individual business locations

Next, as the main considerations when modeling the supply chain, I believe that by advancing the modeling from the following perspectives, it is possible to realize a supply chain planning function that is practicalc:

1. Plan with a weekly granularity
2. Align with common product lots (common planning units) across the entire supply chain
3. Consider bottlenecks on both the supply side and the demand side
4. Consider the cost structure and value linkage of each business location
5. Apply optimization functions (mainly supply allocation problems, location problems, routing problems, etc.)

To verify these concepts (Proof of Concept: PoC), I have created a simple planning tool modeled in Python, which I would like to introduce.
